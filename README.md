# Quick TODO-Event Extension for Raycast

Simple fork of [mblode/raycast-quick-event](https://github.com/mblode/raycast-quick-event) for those people who use the calendar-app as a to-do list.

Changes:
- text parsing is disabled
- the default day was set for the following Saturday
- the default duration of an event was set to 30'
